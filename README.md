# The Flowge Project

> Made with ðŸ’–, our goal is to make a powerful and super easy to learn language with knowledge that you probably already know if you use Java, C#, C, C++, TypeScript or more.

Why Flowge ?

You don't especially need flowge, for a static program. For exemple, if you write down: 
```
print((string) 1 + 1);
```

Because the optimizer of Flowge will done the process of nd, 2turning 1 + 1 into 2 a into a string.
So basically for this kind of "static" program which never change, Flowge don't really make sens, because all the process will be do while the compilation.

We can understand that all is "static" or depending on the code, will be do as much close before become out the process.

So if you create a program with Flowge, which do your homework, and the entry of homework is put into the code (why not), while you compile the program, your homework will be do. And when you run it, that will be instantly print into the terminal.

So flowge is special that all can be do one time, is do only one time.

But, in case that you're creating a super extra large array, what's happend ? Will you get a 1go program? No, of course not. Because there's a memory limitation to one-time-optimization or OTO.
And secondly, because if you don't print the value (or do something that is unpredictable), that will be not saving it as OTO, not because you don't print it, but because print something depends on the operating system who run the program.

Anyway, all about algebric operation is of course reduce to the most fatest resolvable calcul (which save memory btw)
