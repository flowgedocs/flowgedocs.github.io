# Get Started With Flowge

Understand our differences and similitude compared to common languages, is the first thing you must know.

**Understand Project Structure**

Flowge is an object oriented language; in Java, bootable object is a static method inside a class, in C# it's a static method inside a static class, in C/C++ it's a method.

> This is the base-structure of a project in Flowge:

```
build/
    myproject.exe
    myproject.dp.flg
    ...
src/
    ...
project/
    program.x.flg
    debug.x.flg
    config.json
    ...
```
